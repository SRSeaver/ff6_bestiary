# FF VI Bestiary Data

Took a look at some FF VI enemy info for my son.  Wanted to see if I could predict whether or not an enemy was a _boss_ based on the basic character data for each.  Turns out you can do so to a very high degree.  Also, the game was originally released in 1993, but re-released in the 2010s on mobile devices.  The mobile releases featured new end-game enemies and I wanted to see how they stacked up against the original enemies.
